# FriendFinder

This app is designed to take a survey response from he user and compare it with other people's responses.  It is then supposed to calculate which person's answers matched most similarly to those of the user and display that person's name and photo as a modal to the user.  

I was not able to complete the assignment in the alloted time.  I tried to do it mostly by myself, by watching the Hot Restaurant video and referring to the Hot Restuarant code but I still needed to figure out how to compare the user's score array with that of the other potential "friend's" score array and then display that person as a modal to the user.  I will try to complete the assignment on Fri. July 13.
